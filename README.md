Dynamically generates user-interfaces. 

Diamond is a system for generating user interfaces.  The basic notion
is that UIs are generated to modify data structures and program states
in a repeatable yet customizable fashion.  Expert systems and KBs for
generating interfaces, like the MayaViz project to the same effect.
Interfaces for editting arbitrary data structures.  Cognitive
modelling of the user to enhance the effectiveness of the interface.
Dynamic generation of the interface.  Device specific target interface
generation.

Here  are some  of the  neat features  of Diamond.   It maintains,
through  Audience,   an  administrators  profile   of  all  active
sessions.  Sessions can be reconnected to at a later time (in most
cases).  Diamond ensures load  balancing for these applications to
provide availability.  

There are several different targets.

Of the different platforms for  these targets are: CGI, AJAX, GTK,
ncurses, etc.
