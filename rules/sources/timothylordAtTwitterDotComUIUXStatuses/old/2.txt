#ui #ux -- pretty important! Also: Please download the accelerator software and therefore agree to abusive, un-read terms, for even faster missile delivery. 

Not even going to name; shame's enough. If you design a c. card entry field, please don't do almost anything this one does. Why's the CC# the shortest field? Why's the entry field so far from its label? Why's the field that needs 4 chars max the longest? #ux #ui #design #inhumane

As you step backward through a chain of actions (in a word processing doc, e.g.), "undo" becomes ambiguous. (Why don't two 'undo's cancel out?) More useful'd be a narrative list of actions, which could each themselves be undone, independent of the others. #ui #ux #design #cntlZ

Most companies could learn from the way Duo uses blogging. Informative, useful, not self-congratulatory, readable across a wide range of registers. #ux #ui #duosec

For "Contact us!" purposes on a website, It's perfectly fine to steer users to a series of bounded text fields. But please *also* make clear the email address to which the result will go, so people can use that address directly. #ux #ui #adv101 #marketing #CustSvc

If your input field (for any computer input) has a length limit for text (or data limit, such as for a photo upload), it should be easy to tell what that limit is. Character countdown, or thermometer bar, or percentage indicator--all good options. #ux #ui

For blogs with page-by-page archives (and other web pages with similar navigation): "Older" and "Newer" are far less ambiguous than "Next" and "Previous." (Previous could mean in time, or the page you were previously on, not always the same thing.) #ux #ui

It's probably been there for a while (years? I dunno!), but I know I've until recently overlooked the "open in Incognito window" right-click option in #Chrome. Hyper-useful to reading at least certain per-month-limited paywall sites like NYT, and for testing #ux / #ui

There, now that wasn't so hard, was it? OK, I give: No, it wasn't. But it's obnoxious for a grammar checker to be on by default. (Spellchecker, a different beast entirely, IMO.)

Why should posters be able to label their own messages by priority? Because some things are "notes to self," some are actually important, most are somewhere between. If I want to read your critical ones only, I don't want FB/Twitter deciding which they are. #ui #ux #design #noise

Autorotation of images / #ui elements is often the right thing to do -- but not always. Please give users a "lock rotation" option, or at least make it easy to override the auto-rotate choice. (This includes typically widescreen apps; if I want portrait, I want it!) #android #ux

This sounds like a joke, a small perfect storm of intention conflation: #autocorrect on my phone just interpreted the word "radical" (what I meant to write) as "reasonable." Not that they can't both be true (often are!), but very often they're near-opposites. #ux #ui #android

If your #GUI dialog-box based process of any kind has a "Next" / "Continue" button, it should *also* -- dagnabbit, this is not a drill -- have an easy-to-find "Go back" button (or at least a graceful "Start over").  #ux #ui

I'd prefer that "cut" (as in "CTRL-X") when used on read-only text at least act as "copy" ("CTRL-C"). Even though the text, being read-only, won't actually be cut, it should still go in the copy buffer, as least-surprising outcome. #windows #ui #ux #copypaste

I admit to being easily confused by computer interfaces. Still, I can't be the only one to find this message a bit muddled, can I?

When an (actual, in-business) bank uses poor grammar online, it makes spotting online scammers marginally more difficult. #finance #ui #ux

I am not an Online Security Expert™, but I think a bank with a 14-char limit on password length should find someone who is to convince me that's a wise limit to have. Because my guess is that ... it's not. Also: all account sign-up processes suck.  #ux #ui #design #security

Sometimes I really do want to close all the documents related to a particular app (think #thegimp, or a word processor) *without* quitting the app, therefore requiring the whole startup magic picture show a few minutes later.  It's the future; RAM is cheap(ish). #ui #ux #software

#Linux GUIs have largely addressed this, but "Trash" (recoverable) is the best default for most users; "Delete unrecoverably" isn't. #ux #ui

New Layer dialog for #TheGIMP should include options "Make this the bottommost layer" & "Add below currently visible layers." #ux #ui #foss

Find-and-replace is sometimes used for *tiny* things, like commas & missing spaces. Found items should be encircled to draw the eye! #ux #ui

For literalists like me, please vet your (G)UI's option menus for parallelism, tense, ambiguity, &c. zB: "Shut down" ! "Shutdown." #ux #ui

In #GUIs w/ docks, clicking on a docked icon should hide (if on top), show (if hidden), or raise (if lowered) the app. That is all. #ux #ui

I have an older version of #Elementaryos on that 10y-old ThinkPad now: runs nicely.  #FOSS tends toward long-term usefulness. #ux #ui #linux

#gDrive search plaint: if I search for $foo, then click on a doc in results, please take me to an instance of $foo, not just the doc #ux #ui

Huh! Does the default file manager (File Explorer) in #Windows10 really not have tabs? In 2017, I call that inexplicable :) #ui #ux #design

Windows' "Photos" viewer app (on #Win10) has dark edges which make it difficult to find/grab edges against dark b/g. #design #ux #ui #bug

I esp. dislike needing to choose local time vs. GMT for #googlecalander; picked local for simplicity, but want both shown. #design #ux #ui

An option I'd like for anything electronic w/ a clock is to display multiple timezones; local favorite+GMT is a good start. #design #ux #ui

I have discovered the next phase of unbreakable correction, and it is called #autocorrect. Cockney rhyming slang for the new now. #ux #ui

Very cool #travel tool: http://rome2rio.com  Explore distances/means/costs between arbitrary pts. Commendable Google-maps based #ux / #ui

#ux #ui I used to laugh at gaudy window decorations/animations/shadows, but it's important to know which is active! 

I still really need a "focus follows eyeballs" setting for my desktop. Don't know how many times per day I start typing in the wrong window.

Interesting: Suddenly my #Facebook interface is in French (huh?). Whatever button I fat-fingered to effect this, it's puzzling.  #ux #ui

Easy WiFi login #ux / #ui (and available WiFi at retail stores -- I'm on IKEA's right now) is a nice change in #commerce over the last 10y.

Oh, fer fun's sake -- don't offer downloads that don't indicate size, or (optional, 2dary, est'd time based on speed). #ux #ui #design

Well, it's good to have options ... (note invisible sarcasm marks). #ux #ui #holymoley #design

oh. my. god. 

#ux / #ui / #industrialdesign are intimately linked. Everyone who does one should keep the overlap heavily in mind.

#ui / #ux - Touchscreen interface designers: Don't rely on screen gestures without testing: even short-clipped nails can interfere w/ some.

#Twitter #ux / #ui bug on lg. tablets is one that could be fixed by ignoring the usual cries to use more of the screen. Narrow'd work fine.

Amazon's video streaming has one up on Netflix GUI, w/ 10s skip in *both* directions, not just back (though back's more important). #ux #ui

App writers: Please avoid the very edges of screens boxes, &c. Often hard to tell whether there's hidden text, among other reasons. #ux #ui

Other reasons easy to imagine, but I'd like better rotation options in Android to better use a phone w/ a partly-borked digitizer ;) #ux #ui

#Android apps can be inconsistent re: rotation. Ex: VLC rotates to Horiz-up, Horiz-down, & Vert-up. But weirdly, not Vert-down. #ux #ui

I like #TweetDeck; it's pretty neat. I'd like it to make finding Unicode chars easier, though, perhaps w/ a browseable pop-up panel. #ui #ux

On both Chromebook Pixel & Pixel C, the LED bar is brilliant; I want to see it used for more user-signaling stuff. #design #ui #ux #PixelC

Needs to be done carefully (w logs noting old ones?), but "change the name of this document" should be an easy option for many docs. #ux #ui

That #ElementaryOS doesn't come by default with a minimize button for windows  I think is fairly viewed as a bug. #ui #ux #linux

Hard to pin the blame, but the space-saving non-standard #Chrome window means I have no minimize button for it on #ElementaryOS. #ui #ux

#googlekeep puts its "New Note" field *just* where I always expect to search, rather than to make a new one. Should swap positions! #ui #ux

Keyboard makers: Page up / down keys should be easy to find by touch, & IMO are best at an edge of the board. #ux #ui #design

I'd like to have an option such that docs could freely mix tables/text/images/html, but following the "new sheet" spreadsheet model. #ux #ui

Triaging phone calls to business IVRs by area code might've made sense 20y ago; now more harm than good. Looking at you, AAA & USAA. #ux #ui

Android voice-input's pretty neat, but non-intuitive. zB: "OK Google open $app-name" works; "OK Google close $app-name" doesn't. #ui #ux

Now that @Google has weirdly / rudely switched from #Googlevoice to #googlehangouts, it's much, much harder to search for messages #ux #ui

@Googlevoice multi-device-ness is great: answer on tablet, PC, whatever. BUT: don't then show the call as "unanswered" on my phone. #ux #ui

I get it: "noreply@domain.com" is a fine thing for automated messages. But you really ought to give the info *to* reply if needed. #ui #ux

I often use my phone camera for quick visual notes; these rarely need hi-res. "Downgrade res" should be 1st-class option. #android #ux #ui

Buttons that do opposite or irreconcilable things, physical or even more so on-screen, should be at least 1 fingertip width apart. #ux #ui

More on Undo: "Click." < "Confirm?" < "Preview this change, then confirm." < "Preview in context." < "You may now undo this change." #ui #ux
