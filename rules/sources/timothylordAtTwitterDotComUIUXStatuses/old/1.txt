Not even going to name; shame's enough. If you design a c. card entry field, please don't do almost anything this one does. Why's the CC# the shortest field? Why's the entry field so far from its label? Why's the field that needs 4 chars max the longest? #ux #ui #design #inhumane

As you step backward through a chain of actions (in a word processing doc, e.g.), "undo" becomes ambiguous. (Why don't two 'undo's cancel out?) More useful'd be a narrative list of actions, which could each themselves be undone, independent of the others. #ui #ux #design #cntlZ

If your input field (for any computer input) has a length limit for text (or data limit, such as for a photo upload), it should be easy to tell what that limit is. Character countdown, or thermometer bar, or percentage indicator--all good options. #ux #ui

For blogs with page-by-page archives (and other web pages with similar navigation): "Older" and "Newer" are far less ambiguous than "Next" and "Previous." (Previous could mean in time, or the page you were previously on, not always the same thing.) #ux #ui

I'd prefer that "cut" (as in "CTRL-X") when used on read-only text at least act as "copy" ("CTRL-C"). Even though the text, being read-only, won't actually be cut, it should still go in the copy buffer, as least-surprising outcome. #windows #ui #ux #copypaste

#facebook My MBA screen is pretty high-res, but FB's share-a-link process still requires me to scroll; it shouldn't. Resize dialog! #ui #ux

#ux #ui #Android notice for #googlehangouts calls is sticky on my phone; it disappears eventually, but not by sliding it right as it should.

Device makers: tiny black-on-black lettering is the new illegible. You're a few focus groups shy of a kudos if you use it. #ux #ui #design

If you make a device that requires batteries, & they *can* fit in the wrong way, then you should label it, unambiguously. #idiots #ui #ux

#netflix #search: barely better than nothing, sometimes. Search "Canada," & find (bizarre) 3 hits - for a person named Ron Canada. #ux #ui

All cell providers should nab ideas from gVoice. Fwd'ing, call screening, msgs by email, etc; 2 numbers, a pain but worthwhile. #ui #ux

GPS (maybe some do?) should let you enter cities as waypoints *without* an exact address. Just "by way of city X rather than Z" #ui #ux #gps
